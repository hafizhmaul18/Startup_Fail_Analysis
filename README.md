## Startup Fail Analysis
In this project, We gonna find out what is the biggest cause of the failed startup. As we all know, money can cause so much trouble, but surprisingly I found that money is not the biggest problem, so what is the number 1?

### **1. Project Objectives**
We are going to answer some Business Question

- What Happened?

According to the BLS, **1/5 startups fail within their first year**. and **up to 65% of startups will fail within 10 years** of opening for businesses.
As a business consultant,

our client wants us to prevent his startup from going fall.
- why did it happen?

1. 38% of startup failures occur due to financial issues
2. 35% of businesses fail due to lack of market need
3. 20% of businesses fail due to industry competition
4. 19% of businesses fail due to unsuccessful business model
5. 18% of businesses fail due to legal challenges

- What will we do?

We're gonna eksplore fail startup dataset to make a predicition model of failing startup. Then giving insight what is the biggest cause of failing startup?

- How we do that?
1. Using Classification Machine learning to consider is the startup will fail (0) or no
2. Evaluation :
  - **False Positive**: Miss predict success startup as a "No"
  - **False Negative**: Miss predict fail startup as a "Success startup"
3. Use Feature Importance and SHAP to find the causes.

### **2. Data Understanding**

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Startup Lifespan Classification**

![Lifespan Startup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e96dd640-c279-4478-aa13-1c0ed14bcde5)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
- 1.75% startups fail in the first year
- 18.34% startups fail in 3 years
- 61.57% startups fail in 6.5 years
- 84.72% startups fail in 10 years
- Average failed startup ages = 6.15%

The data is Left-skewed, with a peak at around 1000â€“2500 days (about 3â€“6.5 years). The frequency gradually decreases as the lifespan increases.

- 1-3 years (Adapt Phase)
- 3-6,5 years (Critical Phase)
- '>6,5 years (Maturity Phase)
```


**Total Funding Analysis**

![Funding Total](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf404692-9f36-4e77-98aa-b8fb75e20fb3)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
- The median funding for existing startups is higher than failed startups, This suggests that startups with higher funding tend to survive more often.
- The existing have wider range of funding total, it means some successful startup gain more funding that most failed startups.
- Existing have more extreme funding outliers. The farthest outlier for fail startup just reach the beginning of existing outliers.
```


**Funding Round Analysis**

![Funding Round](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0828383-bbd6-4ff8-a8c4-ef60bfd105d5)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
- 43.7% of startups that received funding have closed, This suggests that while funding can help, analyzing other factors like market fit or execution being critical for survival.
- VC  and Angel funding may not always correlate with long-term survival, possibly due to high-risk investments.
- To improve survivability, startups should aim to advance to later funding stages while balancing growth with operational stability.
```


**Relationship Analysis**

![Relationship](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ea73b51-a275-48d2-876b-3b3f2a4f2204)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
we found that startup that have more relations tend to survive. If a startups have more than 20 Professional Relationship, they will strongly survive! 
```


**Relation v Total Funding**

![Relation v Total Funding](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34c74357-17e4-4d7e-aafc-a63e0b110b37)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
Surprisingly, Relations and total funding is not highly correlated. 
```

### **4. Best Modeling**
After training many models, we got the best model and that is :
**Light GBM with SMOTE and Tuning Evaluation**

And here is the Confusion Matrix

### **5. Feature Importance**

![Variable Importance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80779bcf-e77f-4239-945b-5104d8907f11)

**Findings**ðŸŽ¯
```bash
- Relationship : Relation have the biggest impact to the success or the close of a startup.
- Funding_total_usd : Surprisingly, funding is the next after relationship. And from EDA we donâ€™t see any correlations between them.
- Age last milestone
- is_top500
- age first milestone

Why Relationship?
- Access to Resources : Strong relationships enable startups to obtain funding, mentorship, and relevant technology. Investors not only provide money but also open access to partner or customer networks.
- Reputation and Credibility : Relationships with influential figures (political figures/influencers or artist) can increase market trust and accelerate startup growth.
- Growth Acceleration : Partnering with large companies or institutions can expand market access and facilitate product penetration. Example: Fintech startups that start with large banks gain credibility and customers faster.
