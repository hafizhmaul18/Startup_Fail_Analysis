# Startup_Fail_Analysis
This is my final project as a student at Dibimbing.id. In this project, We gonna find out what is the biggest cause of the failed startup. As we all know, money can cause so much trouble, but surprisingly I found that money is the no.2 biggest problem, so what is the number 1?
